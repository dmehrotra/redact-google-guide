I don't like that someone can copy the handmade birdhouse i put in my window because I'm trying to start a birdhouse business.
This is the capitol building for my imaginary government, it is a security hazard to have this publically viewable.
I don't like that someone can see that you they could lower yourself onto my fire escape and steal my stuff. 
I dont like someone could potentially see that I might be walking around naked in my living room if they are looking at my window from this angle, because I like to walk around naked, but thats really none of your business.
I'm planning on getting really famous, and i don't want my house to be visible on google maps
I am really famous, you might not have heard of me and don't try googling me, but trust me i'm famous, and i hate that people can figure out what color my door is painted.
I am an onsite lawyer for a big corporation called xxxxxxxxx, you might not have heard of us, but my client's IP is visible in this photo.
That cat in the window is mine, i don't want anyone to take him or know hes mine.
